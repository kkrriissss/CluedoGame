If none of the code works because of your machine, then refer to this:

I code on Linux with wsl and I did the whole project there, and it worked there perfectly. After that I made a folder on my windows side of my machine and I did the same exact steps on chatgpt and it worked as well...

Let me know if none of this works, or you can follow the chatgpt and ask questions accordingly to your situation.
